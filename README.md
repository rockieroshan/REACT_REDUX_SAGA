# Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Task

You will be creating _Weather App_ that shows the current weather and the 5-day forecast of the location users type in the search field.

## Acceptance Criteria

* The implementation shouldn't be 100% pixel perfect, although the page should look very similar to the screenshot above.
* The website should look nice on all screens (there is no rule book for that, just use your style feeling creativity).
* The website should work in all modern browsers.
* Please write at least 1 unit test with JEST and 1 e2e test with Cypress
* Optional: requests can be cached in browser.
* Linters, prettifiers, etc. are not mandatory, but highly recommended.

## Tips

* For weather data you may use https://openweathermap.org/.
* For icons you may use https://www.flaticon.com/.
* For fonts you may use https://fonts.google.com/.
* Use your UI/UX experience to make the page user fiendly.
* You are an expert, show your skills! Want to wrap the project into a Docker container, do it. Want to use Redux, why not? But be prepared to explain why you made your decisions.

Please ask questions if you have any.

Good luck!# REACT_REDUX_SAGA
